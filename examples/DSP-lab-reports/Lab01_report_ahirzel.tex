\chapter{Introduction}

This report presents the information from Lab 1, which consists of the analysis
of the following three systems:
\[
H(s) = \frac{1}{s+4}
\qquad\qquad
y[n]-0.5y[n-1]=2x[n]
\qquad\qquad
y[n]-1.4y[n-1]+C y[n-2]=x[n]
\]

\chapter{Project 2}

Two systems are analyzed in this project:
\begin{align}
y[n]-0.5y[n-1]=2x[n] \label{eq:2-first}\\
y[n]-1.4y[n-1]+C y[n-2]=x[n] \label{eq:2-second}
\end{align}

\savedfig{p2_1_filter_response.png}{The step response of system \eqref{eq:2-first} as generated by \texttt{filter} for question 1(b).\label{fig:21-filter-response}}

Shown in figures \ref{fig:21-dtsimgui-responses} and
\ref{fig:21-filter-response} (respectively) are the responses of system
\eqref{eq:2-first} to a step input. These two figures are in exact agreement on
the step response, which is to be expected.

Shown in many preceeding figures are the responses of system \eqref{eq:2-second}
to a step input. \autoref{tab:final-value-vs-C} shows the final value taken on
by the system as a function of the constant $C$. This varying coefficient allows
the exploration of the stability of the filter because for some values of $C$
the filter is both stable and divergent.

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\caption{Final value of the step response of $y[n] - 1.4y[n-1] + C y[n-2] =
x[n]$ for varying $C$.\label{tab:final-value-vs-C}}
\begin{tabular}{cc}
$C$ & Final value \\
\midrule
0.5 & 10 \\
0.6 & 5 \\
0.7 & 3.3334 \\
0.8 & 2.5027 \\
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The characteristic equation $z^2 - 1.4z + C = 0$ of system \eqref{eq:2-second}
has roots according to the quadratic equation\footnote{$ax^2+bx+c=0 \iff x=(-b
\pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4 a c})/(2a)$.}. These roots are less than unity when \[ \left|
\frac{1.4 \pm \sqrt{1.96 - 4C}}{2} \right| < 1 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \boxed{C
> 0.4 \text{ or } C > 0.4}\text{.} \] It is under the opposite of this condition
that the system is unstable. That is to say: when $C<0.4$, the system is
unstable and when $C=0.4$ the system is marginally stable. This stability
criterion is rooted in the iterative nature of the filter. Specifically, looking
at the difference equation form of the system, \[ y[n] = x[n] - 1.4y[n-1] + C
y[n-2] \] it can be inferred that if approximately steady-state conditions are
assumed---specifically that $y[n]$ is not changing much during each iteration
(making $y[n-1]\approx{}y[n-2]$) and $x=1$ (because a step response is under
consideration)---then the final value of $y[n]$ is approximated by:
\begin{align}
\smash{\stackrel{\approx}{y}}[n] &= 1 - 1.4y[n-1] + C y[n-1] \notag \\
                                 &= 1 - (1.4 - C) y[n-1] \label{eq:approx}
\end{align}
which will grow without bound unless $1.4 - C < 1$ (i.e. $C>0.4$) due to the
recursive nature of the filter. As can be seen in \eqref{eq:approx}, if $C=0.4$,
then $y[n]=1 - y[n-1]$. This implies marignal stability about $y[n]=1$ with
$C=0.4$.

\end{figure}

The same story is told by \autoref{fig:unstables}, which shows the step
response with $C=0.4,0.3,0.2$. The left-most plot ($C=0.4$) shows marginal
stability in the form of a divergent, perfectly linear output. Decreasing
values of $C$ force more rapid divergence.
